# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with PyTorch

## 📖 Overview
This project predicts **used car prices** using a regression model built in **PyTorch**.  
It covers the complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model inference, including:

- 🧩 **Structured data preprocessing** with numeric clipping, categorical encoding, and feature normalization  
- 📊 **Neural Network Regression Model** with **Batch Normalization** and **Dropout** for better training stability and generalization  
- ⚖️ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function  
- 🧠 **Adam optimizer** for training  
- 🔀 **Train/Validation/Test split** for robust evaluation  
- 📈 **Feature & target normalization** using training statistics  
- 💾 **Saving/loading trained model and preprocessing artifacts** for inference  

---

## 🧩 Libraries
- **PyTorch** – model, training, and inference  
- **pandas** – data handling & preprocessing  
- **scikit-learn** – dataset splitting, standardization, one-hot encoding  
- **matplotlib** – plotting loss curves
